# Laravel Navasan Integration

This PHP code is specific to the Laravel framework and is used to connect a website to [navasan.tech](https://navasan.tech) services. To use it, you must purchase an access token from the Navasan website.

## Purpose
The purpose of this service is to limit the number of requests to the main Navasan services and customize the output of the requests. The first web service is optional because the number of requests to the Navasan web service is limited, so it's better to control the number of requests through an intermediary service. The second key, used for connecting to Navasan, is mandatory.
